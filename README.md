# ConstructionActionRecognition

This is repository for the "A novel Transformer based deep learning model and video dataset for unsafe action identification in construction projects".

This repository is based on 

[kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch.git) --> (R3D, R2+1D), 

[rwightman/pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models.git) --> (ViT),

[mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2.git) --> (SlowFast, TSN, TSM),

[m-bain/video-transformers](https://github.com/m-bain/video-transformers) --> (TimeSformer),

The code and dataset will be upload later...
