# ConstructionActionRecognition

This is repository for the "A novel Transformer based deep learning model and video dataset for unsafe action identification in construction projects".

This repository is based on [kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch.git), [rwightman/pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models.git) and [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2.git).

The code and dataset will be upload after the paper is accept.
